//! Example of a minimal routing node.
//!
//! This example node can connect to the other nodes, perform section operations like split,
//! relocation, promotion and demotion and print important updates to the stdout. It doesn't
//! currently do anything else, in particular it doesn't support sending/receiving user messages or
//! voting for user observations. Such features might be added in the future.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Run as a standalone binary:
//!
//!     minimal ARGS...
//!
//! Or via cargo (release mode recommended):
//!
//!     cargo run --release --example minimal -- ARGS...
//!
//! Run with `--help` (or `-h`) to see the command line options and their explanation.
//!
//!
//! # Multiple nodes
//!
//! It is possible to start multiple nodes with a single invocation of this example. Such nodes
//! would all run within the same process, but each in its own thread. See the `--count` (or `-c`)
//! command-line option for more details.
//!
